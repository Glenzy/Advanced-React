# My take on this course

This is my own implementation of this course. I've just used it as a guide. My version is using completely updated versions of React and Apollo, uses Typescript
and is using hooks and functional components rather than classes. - All the styling is Wes's. My intention wasn't to focus on styling. 

My reasons for doing this are simple, *I want to build something using GraphQL to gain a better understanding of it's workings in the backend and frontend*.

**Q:** Which Extensions for VS Code is Wes using?  
**A:** All my extensions are listed on [my dotfiles repo](https://github.com/wesbos/dotfiles), but specifically this course uses [ESLint](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-eslint) and [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier-vscode).
